        Gabrielle Cot is an oil-on-canvas painting by William-Adolphe
        Bouguereau, produced in 1890. The eponymous subject is the daughter of
        the French painter Pierre Auguste Cot, who was Bouguereau's most notable
        pupil. He started the work as a study for another painting but decided
        to develop it into a full work after becoming enthralled by Gabrielle
        Cot's charm and beauty. It was the only non-commissioned painting he
        ever painted. Bouguereau gifted the painting to Gabrielle Cot's
        grandmother, Madame Duret, and it has been privately held since then. It
        was exhibited to the public in Paris in 1891 and in New York in 1999
